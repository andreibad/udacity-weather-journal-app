# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project calls the https://api.openweathermap.org/  API with a zip code entered by the user, saves the temperature  along with other web page form data into an object in a node.js server application (server.js), and refreshes to UI to display the most temperature in Fahrenheit, the timedate (with millisecond resolution), and the user's comment. 

## Instructions
This will require running  `ndoe server.js` to start the node server, which will run on port 8000, and pointing the browser to the url : http://localhost:8000/ to access the web app.
